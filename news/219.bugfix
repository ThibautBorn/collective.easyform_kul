Make sure action urls are always relative to the easyform object.
And redirect `folder/easyform/folder_contents` to `folder/folder_contents`.
And show a View link in the toolbar when you are in a sub item of a form.
See `issue 219 <https://github.com/collective/collective.easyform/issues/219>`_
and `PR 239 <https://github.com/collective/collective.easyform/pull/239>`_.
